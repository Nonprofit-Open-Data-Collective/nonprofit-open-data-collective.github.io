The goal of the NP Open Data Collective is to expand research capacity of the field by sharing knowledge about data assets and novel research. There are many ways for you to contribute, get involved, or learn more.

Join the **Data and Analytics Common Interest Group** at the annual ARNOVA Conference. 

**Ask** a question through our [discussion forum](https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/discuss).

**Contribute** [new datasets](https://goo.gl/forms/Axzc2gA1uiETOkh63) or methods to link and augment data. 

**Share** solutions. Send us a link to your GitHub repo that demonstrates interesting methods for building or analyzing nonprofit or third sector data and we can link it to the [NODC github account](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective). 

**Follow** us on Twitter. **Read** about new research on the [blog](https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/news/). **Subscribe** to our email list.
