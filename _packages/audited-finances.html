description: "These statements provide fiscal year 2016 revenue, expenditure and balance sheet data for each entity and also include footnotes that often add interesting details (for example, hospitals provide revenue breakdowns between their Medicaid, Medicare and privately insured patients).

This project will need further assistance before it can add value to not-for-profit research.  Specifically, naming and metadata need to be improved so that desired files are easier to find and so that they can be associated with each organization’s 990s.

The statements often appear well before a 990 becomes available. They are harvested from the Census Bureau’s Federal Audit Clearinghouse via a tool posted on GitHub.

Thanks to an introduction from Jesse, we have received a generous offer from University of Indiana to host these files and the extraction process going forward.
