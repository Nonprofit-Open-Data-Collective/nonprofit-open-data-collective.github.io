<h1>Getting Involved</h1>

<p>
A goal in creating this collective is to involve everybody in asking questions and thinking through results, whether technical or not. Please ask questions, share your ideas, and let us know what results you see!
</p>

<p>
Each project page has contact information related to it. We encourage you to share ideas and results for individual projects there. Technical issues should be shared as github issues, which are accessible through the individual project Github repositories.
</p>

<h2>The collective mailing list</h2>

<p>
The main collective mailing list is open and dedicated to three main goals:

<ol style="margin-left: 60px;">
    <li>To help people get connected to project-specific resources</li>
    <li>To help maintain the goals of the collective</li>
    <li>To guide the future directions of the consortium.</li>
</ol>

Guiding members of the consortium have generally contributed an entire project, or helped found it. We welcome your contributions and interest in joining!
