The [New York Times gave a shout-out](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/technology/personaltech/facebook-online-privacy.html) to Citizen Audit, one of the generous contributors to the Nonprofit Open Data Collective. 

In a story about tech tools that investigative reporters find useful, the author says:

> I love a site called Citizen Audit, which provides searchable copies of the tax returns for nonprofit organizations. It’s basically Google for “dark money.”

Nice work Miguel!
