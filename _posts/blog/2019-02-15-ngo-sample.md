David Oldenkamp, formerly the International Documents Librarian at Indiana University, started a database of 415 international NGOs and their web domains. [The list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZrdxJay_bIQtb1V6OAJBxMAEIJV8vzrvN3zzXD7jM/edit?hl=en&hl=en#gid=0) has been expanded and incorporated into a an NGO custom search engine to search within all of the domains for content. 

It's not clear how the list was generated and how well it has been maintained, but it is an interesting concept as a sampling framework.
