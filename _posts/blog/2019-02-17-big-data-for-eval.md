A couple of recent publications highlight potential uses of "big data" for traditional M&E or program evaluation purposes.

A UN Women feasibility study.” United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

These reports include a variety of non-traditional data sources and many interesting examples.
