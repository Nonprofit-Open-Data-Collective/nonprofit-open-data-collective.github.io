[The Generosity Commission](https://www.thegenerositycommission.org/research/) is a non-partisan organization that promotes research on changes in the level of volunteering and charitable giving in the United States. 

In a recent grant RFP they included a nice appendix summarizing some of the most useful public databases for nonprofit scholarship. It's a great place to direct PhD students or scholars getting started on a new topic and looking for data sources to measure variables of interest. 

The list can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/raw/master/_posts/blog/papers/data-for-nonprofit-research.pdf).
