The BBC has published their [Graphics Library](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/) built using ggplot2 in R.

The library represents a good example of how templates can be used to codify expertise within a team so that it is easier to share and retain. They were kind enough to create a custom [R package](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot) so that others can replicate their work.
