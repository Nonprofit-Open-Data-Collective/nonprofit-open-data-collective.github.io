<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>The NIPY community is a community of practice devoted to the use of the Python programming language in the analysis of neuroimaging data. The following code of conduct is a guideline for our behavior as we participate in this community.</p>

<p>It is based on, and heavily inspired by a reading of the Python community code of conduct, the Apache foundation code of conduct, the Debian code of conduct, and the Ten Principles of Burning Man.</p>

<h2>The code of conduct for the NIPY community</h2>

<p>The Neuroimaging in Python (NIPY) community is made up of members with a diverse set of skills, personalities, background, and experiences. We welcome these differences because they are the source of diverse ideas, solutions and decisions about our work. Decisions we make affect users, colleagues, and through scientific results, the general public. We take these consequences seriously when making decisions. When you are working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines, which help steer our interactions and help keep NIPY a positive, successful, and growing community.</p>

<h3>A member of the NIPY community is:</h3>

<h4>Open</h4>

<p>Members of the community are open to collaboration. Be it on the reuse of data, on the implementation of methods, on finding technical solutions, establishing best practices, and otherwise. We are accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.</p>

<h4>Be collaborative!</h4>

<p>Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of others, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. We are willing to provide constructive criticism on the work of others and accept criticism of our own work, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.</p>

<h4>Be inquisitive!</h4>

<p>Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving neuroimaging practice.</p>

<h4>Considerate</h4>

<p>Members of the community are considerate of their peers. We are thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often-times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We are attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we are tactful when approaching differing views.</p>

<h4>Be careful in the words that you choose:</h4>

<p>We value courtesy, kindness and inclusiveness in all our interactions. Therefore, we take responsibility for our own speech. In particular, we avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal insults.</li>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Any form of sexual or violent material.</li>
<li>Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.</li>
<li>Excessive or unnecessary profanity.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li>
<li>Try to be concise in communication</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by many others. Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Even short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary.</p>

<p>Try to bring new ideas to a conversation, so that each message adds something unique to the conversation. Keep in mind that, when using email, the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.</p>

<p>Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly long and complex.</p>

<h4>Respectful</h4>

<p>Members of the community are respectful. We are respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We are respectful of the volunteer and professional efforts that permeate the NIPY community. We are respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous and kind in raising our issues.</p>
