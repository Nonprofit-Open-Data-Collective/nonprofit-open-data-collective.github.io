-------------------

> A Common Interest Group has been created at ARNOVA as a way to encourage connections and support research, knowledge dissemination, and mentoring. 

------------------------

<br>


"The purpose of a Common Interest Group is to encourage groups of individuals to come together in an organic and flexible way around shared intellectual topics or professional concerns. These groups can be created for the purpose of networking, exchange of information, development of new fields of investigation or around other emerging opportunities."  [CIG](https://www.arnova.org/page/CIG)

The Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action [(ARNOVA)](https://www.arnova.org/page/About) is the U.S.-based, national and international association that connects scholars, teachers, and practice leaders interested in research on nonprofit organizations, voluntary action, philanthropy and civil society. 




## Upcoming Events

We will convene at the ARNOVA Conference in San Diego in November 2019. If you have panel ideas on new data or methods and are looking for support or collaborators, please share via the [discussion board](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/labels/conferences) or [list-serve](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arnovadatacig).

There are plans to host a competition on machine learning using mission statements to predict activity codes. Stay tuned for more details.
