          question: "How do I add a package?"
          answer: "<h3>Infrastructure and workflow</h3><p>Let's first look at the infrastructure and workflow of the site</p><p><ul class='list-group'><li class='list-group-item'><strong>Github</strong>:The site is a repo under the nipy organization on<a href='nipy.github.com' target='_blank'> github</a>.This means that contribution to it goes by way of forking the repo and doing a pull request (PR).</li><li class='list-group-item'><strong>Github pages</strong>: We also use hosting on github pages, which only means that the site lives on a branch called gh-pages that gets rendered at nipy.github.io.</li><li class='list-group-item'><strong>CI</strong>: We use continuous integration to preview all PRs by way of viewing <a href='https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/vsoch/nipy-jekyll/63/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nipy-jekyll/_site/index.html' target='_blank'>artifacts</a>.</li></ul></p><h3>Your Workflow</h3><p>You should do the following:</p><ul><li>Fork the nipy jekyll repo</li><li>Make your changes</li><li>Submit a PR</li><li>We will review the PR, and push to master and ghpages branches.</li></ul></p><h3>Details</h3><ol><li>Add your package info to the data file, in the same format. This will have it rendered automatically in the navigation, and added to the animated brain on all pages.</li><li>Add a base page for your package in the base directory of the site repo. It should be named [packagetag].html where [packagetag] corresponds with the tag variable in the data file. We have a page template for packages, and the easiest thing to do is copy another package's page to start.</li><li>Static site content can be put in the js,css,img folders in the base directory. Any static content can be linked to like '{{ '/img/myimage.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}'. Keep it organized.</li><li>To contribute an svg image, put it in the '_includes/svg' folder and include like {% include svg/mysvg.svg %}</li><li>Subpages should be contributed as posts to <a href='http://neuroimaging.tumblr.com'>blog content</a>.</li></ol><p>"

          question: "How do I write a post?"
          answer: "<h3>Quick and Easy</h3><p>The fastest way to contribute is to <a href='http://neuroimaging.tumblr.com/submit'> submit </a> an idea, link, or video right away, or <a href='http://neuroimaging.tumblr.com/ask'>ask us a question</a>. Your submission will be reviewed and immediately available on the site and for social media integration.</p><h3>Contribute Regularly</h3><p>If you like writing tutorials, or regularly write about your research, we encourage you to <a href='https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/posting' target='_blank'> read more about posting</a> and <a href='mailto:neuroimaging@python.org'>contact us</a> with your email or tumblr username, and you will be added as a contributor to the blog. As an official contributor you can write posts in several formats, receive notifications, integrate apps, and contribute via email. Contributors are subject to the same standards of conduct as non-affiliated posters.</p><h3>Package Specific</h3><p>To contribute content, or a 'blogroll' for your package, we encourage you to become a tumblr contributor, tag your posts with your package, and <a href='https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/using_tags#specific' target='_blank'>link to the tagged posts</a> from your package page.</p>"
        - tag: "contribute-to-site"
          question: "How do I contribute (otherwise) to the site?"
          answer: "<h3>New site pages</h3><p>New sites pages that are not packages, and not blog content, can be plopped into the base directory, and they will be automatically rendered by jekyll. You will need to add a link to your page in the '_includes/links.html' or from within some other page.</p><h3>New questions on this page</h3><p>The data on this page is rendered from contribute.yml in the _data folder, and so you can add new questions there.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>None of us are 'real' web-developers, and always appreciate fixes to the site theme or look. If you are familiar with <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/' target='_blank'>Jekyll</a> then you can fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR.</p>"
