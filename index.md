### Opening Data for Nonprofit Research

The IRS maintains several important nonprofit databases to track the current population of exempt organizations, their annual 990 filings, and organizations that have closed. This data has been released in formats that are not always easy to use - ASCII text files, json files, and XML queries. 

In order to make the data accessible to the research community, we have created scripts to download data from IRS websites, clean and process it, and export into familiar formats (CSV, Stata, SPSS, etc.).

We have begun the process to catalog and document these resources, and will begin sharing them through the Dataverse Open Data portal:
